# Doing_DataScience_Group_Project
This is a group project on creating projects in RStudio for Doing Datascience Class @ SMU.

We will be using the data from the rolling Data Sales website, linked here(http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page)

Our Dataset is  for Queens neighborhood

### Our Git repository for the project has two folders:
1. _A data directory_ contains a `cleaning.RMD` file to load in `rollingsales_queens.csv` dataset and clean it up. Cleaning the data includes finding outliers or missing values, deciding how you will treat them, making sure values we think are numerical are being treated as such.
2. _An Analysis directory_ contains `analysis.RMD` file for exploratory data analysis on the clean data and  visualization to compare the square footage and sales price for queens neighborhood.
  
## Deliverable:
deliverable for this project will be a link to a repository on GitHub containing our analysis.
