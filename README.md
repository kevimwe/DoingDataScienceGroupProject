# Doing_DataScience_Group_Project
This is a group project on creating projects in RStudio for Doing Datascience Class @ SMU.

We will be using the data from the rolling Data Sales website, linked here(http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page)

## Goal: 
Create an RStudio project for the analysis of this data set. 
Your file structure within the project should include the following:
1. _A README file_ in the project root directory that includes an explanation of the purpose of the project and the other files
2. _A data directory_ containing files to load in and clean up the data. The clean up should include finding out where there are outliers or missing values, deciding how you will treat them, making sure values you think are numerical are being treated as such (correct R class), etc.
3. _An Analysis directory_ containing a file (or files) for exploratory data analysis on the clean data to visualize compare the square footage and sales price for your neighborhood.
  
## Deliverable:
A link to a repository on GitHub containing the above. I need only one link per group. Since this is a group project, I expect you to divide the labor.
